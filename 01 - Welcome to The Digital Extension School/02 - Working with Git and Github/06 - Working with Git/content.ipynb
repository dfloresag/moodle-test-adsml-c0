    "\n",
    "Git is mostly used to track code files, whether for a website, a mobile\n",
    "app, a data analysis project, but not only. You could write a book and\n",
    "track your files with Git. **This entire course was actually tracked\n",
    "with Git while it was being created.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is really useful to track any kind of text-based file. \n",
    "At its core, a “Git project” tracks files in a folder (if the folder contains folders, the files in these are tracked as well). \n",
    "A folder tracked by Git is called a “Git **Repository**”. \n",
    "So every time you decide to track a data science project with Git, it becomes a “Git Repository” (or “Git Repo” for short).\n",
    "\n",
    "Few concepts that you need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Repository**: a folder that contains your project, and that is tracked with Git;\n",
    "- A **Commit**: a commit is a snapshot of your work;\n",
    "- A **Local repository**: the local version of the folder (i.e the folder on your computer that is tracked). A bit like the local version of a Dropbox folder;\n",
    "- A **Remote repository**: the version on the internet (e.g. Github), that is connected to your local repository;\n",
    "- To **push**: means to publish your local changes (your commit) to the remote repository;\n",
    "- To **pull**: means to update the local repository, based on the changes tracked on the remote repository. You will typically do this to update your repository based on changes your collaborators made;\n",
    "- To **clone**: to download a repository from Github to your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following illustration, you can see a simple workflow that you will try in the following unit and you will use to submit your first project. \n",
    "You will indeed first *create a repository* (repo) on Github, then *clone* it to your computer, make changes to it and take a snapshot of an important moment by creating a *commit*. \n",
    "You will then make your changes visible to us (or any collaborator) by *pushing* your commits to Github again.\n"
