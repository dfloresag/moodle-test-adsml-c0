    "2. **Applied Data Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Applied Machine Learning 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applied Machine Learning 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Course 1**, you will be introduced to how to use Python for data science, how to perform basic data manipulation and exploration as well as a little refreshment of some useful mathematical concepts. **Course 2** dives deeper into using data from different sources and coming in different structures. You will also learn more advanced data analysis and data visualization concepts. By the end of the first two courses, you will indeed be able to perform a thorough exploratory data analysis of different messy datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In **Courses 3 and 4**, you will then deep dive into machine learning. You will build models in Python, from basic linear regression to neural networks, and apply machine learning concepts to real-life examples. **Course 3** will use regression problems to introduce key concepts and approaches of the machine learning pipeline using the sklearn package. These are expanded further in **course 4**, where you will work on classification tasks and unsupervised learning problems before diving into some deep learning with Tensorflow."

But remember everyone has their own learning approach. The menu on the right shows you in which unit you are in the current course and subject. It also shows you the completion rate of the subject and the course. Please note that courses, as well as subjects and units, vary in length. For example, the first course is a bit shorter than the others as it introduces the general topics, deals with the setup of the working environment, and revises a view concept. In the machine learning courses, the units tend to be longer as we generally need more steps and code to demonstrate more complex concepts or train models."
